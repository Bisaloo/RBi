- DONE either move to S4 _or_ have some external functions to use with dplyr
  - DONE private functions? Sample and filter as public functions (as well as all other 'client' functions)
  - CANCELLED maybe even better: use R.methodsS3
  - DONE main problem: I don't want to modify the object itself, but if the output file gets overwritten any bi_read will yield something else. Perhaps save the time stamp and issue an error if it's changed? yes!
- DONE cache!
  - DONE every time bi_read is called, cache whatever is in there (unless cache=FALSE)
  - DONE clear cache every time 'run' is called
- DONE summary/str function, as in RStan -- focus on parameters
- DONE put out warning if noutputs is inferred
- CANCELLED maybe a "clock" option? Or 'ignore_clock' in 'bi_read'?
- DONE change recreate_libbi to libbi?
- DONE 'type' option for bi_read (and 'model'):
  > res <- libbi(ebola_model) %>% sample(nsamples=10, end_time=100, obs=test) %>% bi_read(type="param") ## yes, this works now
- CANCELLED need to think about bi_read anyway -- could it be an S3 method?
- DONE thin option to run, field in libbi

- DONE write function? Would need to write all files
- DONE concatenate option or something of sorts in run? Of init, take last one?
- DONE output_all option (in run, as in verbose in my Zika etc model)

- DONE adapt_proposal: don't do anything if min=0 and max=1
- DONE plot_libbi: respect order of states (just refactor at the end)
- DONE adapt_proposal/adapt_particles need some initial output
- DONE make recreate_libbi work with timestamp check

- DONE function to exctract a single trajectory (np)
- check if with-obs-to-state would do the same as sample_obs=TRUE
- change plot_libbi to only read in what's needed
- DONE 'predict' alias for sample(target="prediction")
- DONE update 'bi_model' doc
