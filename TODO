## TODO

- try the rerun method of bi_wrapper (experimental)
- think about how to create data frame easily from NetCDF files
(kinda the opposite of netcdf_create_from_list ?!)
- re introduce some plot function such as traceplot and weighted histogram at least
- clean the inst/ subfolder 
- remove all dependencies from ncdf, and rely only on NetCDF C++ interface ? (partially done already)
- rethink about the names bi_*... bi_wrapper ...
- create Jarvis like in Iron Man to improve general workflow
- when no stdoutput_file_name is given to run(), the results should not include a meaningless path
