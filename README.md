RBi
===

[RBi] (https://github.com/libbi/RBi) is an interface to [libbi] (https://github.com/libbi/LibBi), a library for Bayesian Inference.

It mainly contains:
- a wrapper to call libbi, allowing to perform the full inference from within R,
- various functions to retrieve the results (which are in the NetCDF format) from libbi and to process them.

[Rbi] (https://github.com/libbi/RBi) is under active development.
